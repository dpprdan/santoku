Updated methods to ensure generic/method consistency, fixing a CRAN check.

## Test environments

* local (macOS), R 4.2.0
* github (windows, macOS, Ubuntu), devel and release
* win-builder (windows), devel and release
* mac-builder release
* r-hub (windows), devel

## R CMD check results

* One NOTE about a link to r-universe in the README on win-builder. Fixed.
* One NOTE about 'lastMiKTeXException' in temp directory on r-hub builder for
  windows. Not reproducible, probably a one-off.

## Reverse dependencies

* None.
