santoku is a versatile cutting tool for R. It provides `chop()`, a replacement
for `base::cut()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hughjonesd/santoku")
```

## Basic usage

Use `chop()` like `cut()` to cut your data up:

```{r}
library(santoku)
x <- runif(10, 0, 10)
chopped <- chop(x, breaks = 0:10)
data.frame(x, chopped)
```

`chop()` returns a factor.

If data is beyond the limits of `breaks`, they will be extended automatically:

```{r}
chop(x, breaks = 3:7)
```

To chop a single number into a separate category, put the number twice in
`breaks`:

```{r}
x_fives <- c(x, rep(5, 5))
chop(x_fives, c(2, 5, 5, 8))
```

To chop data up by quantiles, use `chop_quantiles()`:

```{r}
chop_quantiles(x, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

To chop into `n` equal sized groups use `chop_equal()`:

```{r}
chop_equal(x, 3)
```

To chop into fixed-width intervals, starting at the minimum value, use
`chop_width()`:

```{r}
chop_width(x, 2)
```
