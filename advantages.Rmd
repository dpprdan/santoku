santoku is a versatile cutting tool for R. It provides `chop()`, a replacement
for `base::cut()`.

## Advantages

 Here are some advantages of santoku:

 * By default, `chop()` always covers the whole range of the data, so you
   won't get unexpected `NA` values.

 * `chop()` can handle single values as well as intervals. For example, 
   `chop(x, breaks = c(1, 2, 2, 3))` will create a separate factor level for
   values exactly equal to 2.

 * `chop()` can handle many kinds of data, including numbers, dates and 
   times.

 * `chop_*` functions create intervals in many ways, using quantiles of the data, 
   standard deviations, fixed-width intervals, equal-sized groups, or
   pretty intervals for use in graphs.
 
* `lbl_*` functions make it easy to label intervals: use interval notation 
   like `[1, 2)`, dash notation like `1-2`, or arbitrary styles using `glue::glue()`.

 * `tab_*` functions quickly chop data, then tabulate it.

 These advantages make santoku especially useful for exploratory analysis,
 where you may not know the range of your data in advance.
