santoku is a versatile cutting tool for R. It provides `kut()`, a replacement
for `base::cut()`.

## Advantages

 Here are some advantages of santoku:

 * By default, `kut()` always covers the whole range of the data, so you
 won't get unexpected `NA` values.

 * `kut()` can handle single values as well as intervals. For example, 
   `kut(x, breaks = c(1, 2, 2, 3))` will create a separate factor level for
   values exactly equal to 2.

 * Flexible labelling, including easy ways to label intervals by
   numerals or letters.

 * Convenience functions for creating quantile intervals, evenly-spaced
  intervals or equal-sized groups.

 * Convenience functions for quickly tabulating kutped data.

 These advantages make santoku especially useful for exploratory analysis,
 where you may not know the range of your data in advance.
